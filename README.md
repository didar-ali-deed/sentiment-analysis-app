# Sentiment Analysis Web App

## Overview
This project is a machine learning-based web application that performs sentiment analysis on user-input text. It uses a pre-trained DistilBERT model from Hugging Face to classify text as Positive or Negative, and is deployed as a Flask web app on Render. The app features an enhanced UI with Tailwind CSS styling and emojis for a more engaging user experience.

## Features
- **Sentiment Prediction**: Classifies text as Positive or Negative with confidence scores.
- **Enhanced Web Interface**: A visually appealing UI built with Flask and Tailwind CSS, featuring a gradient background, teal accents, and emojis (üëç for Positive, üëé for Negative) in the results.
- **Deployment**: Hosted live on Render for public access.

## Tech Stack
- **Machine Learning**: Python, Hugging Face Transformers, PyTorch
- **Web Development**: Flask, HTML, Tailwind CSS
- **Deployment**: Render

     ```
   - Set the start command:
     ```bash
     gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT sentiment_analysis_app:app
     ```
2. **Push Requirements**:
   Ensure `requirements.txt` is in the repository.
3. Deploy and access the live URL provided by Render.
